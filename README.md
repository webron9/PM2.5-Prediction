# PM2.5-Prediction

### Project Description
- Conducted in-depth analysis and preprocessing of raw sensor data collected in Lucknow to forecast PM 2.5 levels.
- Employed data cleaning, transformation, and normalization techniques for optimal input to predictive models. Extracted
pertinent features from data attributes, employing custom sequential neural networks and linear regression models.
- Utilized advanced techniques such as dropout layers and batch normalization to enhance model generalization and
performance. Evaluated model effectiveness using the R-squared (R2) metric, providing informative insights.
- Visualized prediction results and model learning processes, showcasing proficiency in data visualization libraries such as
Matplotlib and Seaborn. Leveraged domain knowledge to interpret model outputs and fine-tune model architectures.
